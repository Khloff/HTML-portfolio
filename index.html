    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>Well, I'm a beginner developer and aspiring artist that really should practice more often. I like writing stories and reading them too.
        There isn't really a whole lot to me, I'm a simple man with simple joys in life.</br>
        As I get better and the websites I make get more, presentable, I will add a section here for my webdev portfolio.
    </p>
    <h2><a href="./Art portfolio.html">Drawing exercises</a></h2>
    <p>Here you will find some of my best results while practicing art, I'm following Marc Brunet's art school course.
        exercises which, might not be the best, but they were the best I could do at the time.
    </p>
